Welcome! Thank you for visiting our project repository.

The ultimate goal of this project is to build and deploy ensemble machine learning models in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia on a large dataset (~6 GB), where features are outputs of different climate models, and the target is the actual rainfall observation.

## Data

We will be using [this dataset on figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681). This folder has the output of different climate models as features, and our ultimate goal is to build an ensemble model on these outputs and compare the results with the actual rainfall.
